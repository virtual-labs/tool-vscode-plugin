# Virtual Labs Experiment Authoring Environment

Virtual Labs is an initiative by the Ministry of Education, Government of India, aimed at providing remote access to simulation-based labs across various disciplines in Science and Engineering. This initiative offers students a free and enriching laboratory learning experience through remote experimentation.

This document outlines the usage of the Visual Studio Code Extension developed to streamline the process of authoring Virtual Labs experiments. The extension simplifies common tasks involved in experiment development.

## Getting Started

1. **Install the Extension:**
    * Search for "Virtual Labs Experiment Authoring Environment" in the Visual Studio Code Marketplace and install the extension.
2. **Open a Folder:**
    * In Visual Studio Code, open the folder where you want to create the experiment repository.

    * **Validate:**
        This option runs validation for the code using ESLint and also validates the experiment descriptor against a predefined schema.
    * **Build Local:**  
        This creates a build folder inside the experiment repository and builds the experiment locally.
    * **Deploy Local:** 
        Deploys the experiment locally in a web browser for testing.
    * **Clean:**
        Deletes the build folder.
    * **Deploy for Testing:**
        * This pushes the experiment to the testing branch of the repository and deploys it on GitHub Pages. The following fields need to be filled out:
            * **Github Username:** Enter the developer's GitHub username.
            * **Personal Access Token:** Enter the personal access token, which can be generated by [following these steps](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token).
            * **Commit Message:** Enter a short description summarizing the work done.
            <center><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/virtual-labs/tool-vscode-plugin/main/images/deploy.png"<br> </center>    
    * **Submit for Review:** 
        * This raises a pull request (PR) to the main branch of the experiment repository. The following fields need to be filled:
            * **Pull Request Title:** Enter the title of the pull request.
            * **Personal Access Token:** Enter the personal access token (follow the steps given [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token)).

## Known issues and Workarounds:
When using the Virtual Labs Experiment Authoring Environment, you may encounter the following issues. Here are some common issues along with workarounds to ensure smooth usage of the extension:

* **Multiple Experiment Folders in the Same Directory:**
  * **Issue:** If multiple experiment folders are present in the same directory, the extension may not work as expected.
  * **Workaround:** You must open the specific folder you are working on in Visual Studio Code. The extension only operates within the currently opened folder.

* **Deploy for Testing - Write Permissions:**
  * **Issue:** The Deploy for Testing functionality requires proper write permissions to the repository.
  * **Workaround:** Ensure that you have the necessary write permissions before attempting to deploy. If permissions are insufficient, request access from the repository owner.

* **Branch Management:**
  * **Issue:** After initializing an experiment, the branch is automatically set to dev.
  * **Workaround:** Do not manually change the branch via the terminal or command line, as the extension manages the branch switching automatically.

* **Directory Names:**
  * **Issue:** Directory names containing spaces may cause issues during deployment or operation.
  * **Workaround:** Ensure that all directory names are free of spaces.

* **Testing Content Changes:**
  * **Issue:** When testing changes made to the experiment content, the current session may not reflect updates.
  * **Workaround:** Stop the current session and click on Deploy for Testing again to see the updated content.

* **npm and node.js Versions:**
  * **Issue:** Using outdated versions of npm or node.js may result in compatibility issues.
  * **Workaround:** Make sure to use the latest versions of npm and node.js. The minimum required version for node.js is 16.0.0.

* **Visual Studio Code Version:**
  * **Issue:** Using an outdated version of Visual Studio Code may affect the extensionâ€™s functionality.
  * **Workaround:** Ensure you are using the latest version of Visual Studio Code to avoid any issues.
