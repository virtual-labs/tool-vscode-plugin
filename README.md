# Virtual Labs Experiment Authoring Environment

Virtual Labs is an initiative by the Ministry of Education, Government of India, that aims to provide remote access to simulation-based Labs in various disciplines of Science and Engineering. It also provides students to a free laboratory learning experience through remote experimentation.

    * **Deploy Local** - This deploys the experiment locally on a web browser for the user to test.
    * **Clean**- This deletes the build folder.
    * **Deploy for Testing**- This pushes the experiment to the testing branch of the experiment repository and deploys the experiment on the Github pages of Virtual Labs.

**Note**: 
- If there are multiple experiment folders in a directory, the folder needs to be opened on VS Code to work on, and this extension will work only on that folder.
- Before using the **Deploy for Testing** functionality of the extension, make sure to gain write permissions for the repository.
- After initializing the experiment, the branch will be set to dev by default. Please don't change the branch manually using the command line/terminal, as the extension takes care of it on its own.
- Make sure that directory names do not contain spaces.
- Try to use the latest version of npm and nodejs. The minimum requirement for nodejs version is 16.0.0 .
- Also, make sure to install the latest version of Visual Studio Code.
